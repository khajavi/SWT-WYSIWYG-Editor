1. What is the DJ Project - Sweet?

The DJ Project is a set of tools and libraries to enhance the user experience of
Java on the Desktop.

DJ Sweet provides a sophisticated component suite for SWT.
The key components are a richer web browser and a flash player.


2. How to use it?

Simply place the DJSweet.jar library in your classpath, as well as the SWT 3.5
library corresponding to your platform (visit http://www.eclipse.org/swt).
You may need to refer to the SWT FAQ (http://www.eclipse.org/swt/faq.php) to get
it working on certain platforms (like the need to install XULRunner on Linux).
Java 5.0 or later is required.

If you want to use the HTML editor, you need the zip of the FCK editor or the
Tiny MCE editor in your classpath.

If you want to use the syntax highlighter, you need zip of the SyntaxHighlighter
in your classpath.

3. Any tutorial or demo?

The DJ Sweet Demo presents all the features of the Sweet library, along with
the corresponding code. Simply launch DJSweet-Demo.jar.

By default, the Windows version of SWT is provided and in the demo's classpath.
If you wish to try on a different platform, simply place the corresponding SWT
library, (re-)named swt.jar alongside DJSweet-Demo.jar.


4. What is the development status?

The library is tested on Windows and Linux, and logically works on all the
platforms where SWT is supported.

For information about the current implementation status, visit the DJ Project's
website.


5. Sources?

The sources are part of the distribution.
There is of course some access to the CVS tree, from the Sourceforge website.

For the sources of the SWT libraries, check the eclipse repositories. 


6. Troubleshooting?

In case of a problem with the framework or some components, it is possible to
activate certain system properties in order to get more information.

The list of properties can be found in SystemProperties.txt.
